# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the AURA JOURNAL mental journaling application from a development prototype into a production-ready, scalable, and secure application suitable for real users. This involves implementing comprehensive security measures, performance optimizations, monitoring systems, deployment infrastructure, and user management features while maintaining the core journaling and AI analysis functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely create an account and log in to access my personal journal entries, so that my private thoughts and data are protected and only accessible to me.

3. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL provide a JWT token for authenticated requests
4. WHEN a user makes API requests THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and authorize access to user-specific data
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current session token

### Requirement 2: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my journal entries and personal data to be encrypted and secure, so that my private thoughts cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN journal entries are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN data is transmitted between client and server THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption
3. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
4. WHEN personal data is processed THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR and privacy regulations
5. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all associated data within 30 days

### Requirement 3: Production Infrastructure and Deployment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application deployed on reliable cloud infrastructure with automated deployment pipelines, so that the service is highly available and can be maintained efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use containerized services with orchestration (Kubernetes or Docker Swarm)
2. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically run CI/CD pipeline with tests and deployment
3. WHEN services are deployed THEN the system SHALL implement health checks and readiness probes
4. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale services based on load
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments with rollback capability

### Requirement 4: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging of the application, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL collect and store application logs with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL monitor key metrics (response time, error rate, resource usage)
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators within 5 minutes
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed traces for debugging
5. WHEN users report issues THEN the system SHALL provide audit trails for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly and handle my requests efficiently, so that my journaling experience is smooth and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a journal entry THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 concurrent users
3. WHEN loading journal history THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and caching for fast retrieval
4. WHEN analyzing text with AI THEN the system SHALL cache results to avoid redundant API calls
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use optimized indexes and connection pooling

### Requirement 6: Data Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want assurance that my journal entries are safely backed up, so that I won't lose my personal data due to system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL create automated daily backups of all databases
2. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and test restoration procedures
3. WHEN a disaster occurs THEN the system SHALL restore service within 4 hours using backup data
4. WHEN backups are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them and store in geographically distributed locations
5. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to backup systems

### Requirement 7: API Rate Limiting and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to protect the API from abuse and attacks, so that the service remains available for legitimate users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user and IP address
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL temporarily block the source
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL validate input data and prevent injection attacks
4. WHEN external services are called THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breakers for resilience
5. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL rotate them regularly and monitor usage

### Requirement 8: Mobile App Production Features

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a polished app experience with offline capabilities and proper error handling, so that I can journal anytime and anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is offline THEN the app SHALL allow users to create entries and sync when connection is restored
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the app SHALL display user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN the app is published THEN the system SHALL support app store deployment for iOS and Android
4. WHEN users interact with the app THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and responsive UI
5. WHEN app updates are available THEN the system SHALL notify users and support over-the-air updates

### Requirement 9: Analytics and Business Intelligence

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to understand user behavior and app performance through analytics, so that I can make data-driven decisions for product improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the app THEN the system SHALL collect anonymized usage analytics
2. WHEN analytics data is collected THEN the system SHALL respect user privacy preferences and consent
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards for user engagement and app performance
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in user behavior and feature usage
5. WHEN privacy regulations apply THEN the system SHALL ensure analytics comply with GDPR and similar laws

### Requirement 10: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment separation and configuration management, so that I can safely deploy and test changes across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL maintain separate configurations for development, staging, and production
2. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL use secure secret management tools (not plain text files)
3. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading without service restart where possible
4. WHEN configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL validate configuration before applying changes
5. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide environment-specific logging and debugging capabilities
